# Profile Image Placeholder

This directory should contain:

## Required Images:

- **profile.jpg** - Your main profile photo (recommended: 400x400px, square format)

## Recommended Image Specifications:

- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Size:** 400x400 pixels (square)
- **Quality:** High resolution, well-lit, professional appearance
- **Background:** Simple, non-distracting background

## Tips for Great Profile Photos:

1. Use good lighting (natural light is best)
2. Look directly at the camera
3. Keep a professional but approachable expression
4. Wear professional attire
5. Use a simple, clean background

## Current Fallback:

If profile.jpg is not found, the website will automatically use a professional stock photo from Unsplash.

To add your photo:

1. Save your profile photo as `profile.jpg` in this directory
2. Ensure it's properly sized (400x400px recommended)
3. Test the website to make sure it loads correctly

## Additional Project Images:

You can also add project screenshots here:

- project-uninexus.jpg
- project-uiu-media.jpg
- project-iot-car.jpg
- etc.

Name them descriptively and update the portfolio.json file to reference them.
